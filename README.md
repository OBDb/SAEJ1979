# SAEJ1979 Standard PIDs

This repository contains the Parameter IDs (PIDs) from the SAE J1979 standard, commonly used for onboard diagnostics (OBD) and vehicle telematics. The data provided here enables users to query and interpret various parameters related to engine performance, emissions, and other critical functions in compliance with the SAE J1979 standard.

## Overview

**SAE J1979**, also known as OBD-II, is a standard developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). It provides a universal way to access diagnostic data from a vehicle's onboard computer through a standardized set of **Parameter IDs (PIDs)**. The primary purpose of this standard is to ensure that all vehicles manufactured for use in the United States (and many other regions) support a consistent set of data points, which can be accessed via a compatible scan tool.

For more information, please refer to [SAE J1979 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs).

## Purpose of This Repository

The repository aims to provide a comprehensive list of PIDs specified by the SAE J1979 standard. This can be useful for:

- Automotive engineers and technicians who need to access specific diagnostic information.
- Developers creating diagnostic tools and software for reading OBD-II data.
- Enthusiasts interested in understanding vehicle performance data.

## SAE J1979 PIDs

The SAE J1979 standard includes a range of PIDs, each corresponding to specific data points like engine RPM, vehicle speed, fuel level, and more. These PIDs are used to retrieve data from the car's Engine Control Module (ECM) and can be read using an OBD-II scanner or a compatible software application.

Each PID has:

- **PID Code**: The unique identifier to access specific vehicle data.
- **Description**: A brief description of the data the PID represents.
- **Units**: Units in which the data is represented (e.g., RPM, km/h).
- **Formula**: A calculation used to interpret the raw data.
